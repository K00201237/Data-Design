# Data-Design Project

In this project, I applied my knowledge of SQL to create procedures that can return specific details from tables in a database. I used various SQL commands and clauses, such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc in order to manipulate and query data. I also used aggregate functions, such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX, to perform calculations on the data. Some of the tasks that I completed in this project are:
Creating a procedure that returns customers from a specific city.
Creating a procedure that returns the number of items purchased by a customer.
Creating a procedure that sums the number of items bought by a customer and return the customer rating for that customer.
